## Overview
This AWS Serverless application is intended to take temperature data from a temperature sensor and send/recieve basic alerts and commands for exceeding temperature thresholds, etc. via SMS or email.

I built this while evaluating AWS Serverless for its potential as a platform for rapid application development and heavyweight prototyping.  The original version came together in the AWS console in about 10 hours, and is something that I still use to monitor temperatures in my chest freezer at home.
